              The Uganda-Saxony Partnership Cookie Policy sets out how (“us”,
              “we”, or “our”) may use cookies and related tracking technologies
              (collectively, “cookie(s)”) to assist you in accessing and
              navigating the Uganda-Saxony Partnership websites and services. To
              make our websites and services work properly, we sometimes use
              cookies as well as related tracking technologies.

            <h6>What are cookies?</h6>
            <p>
              Cookies are small text files of letters and numbers that are
              placed on your device when you visit a website and are useful
              because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. Our
              Uganda-Saxony Partnership site use cookies, beacons, invisible
              tags, unique IDs and similar technologies to collect information
              about your browsing activities and to distinguish you from other
              users of our Uganda-Saxony Partnership site.

            <h6>How we use cookies</h6>
            <p>
              We use the data we collect from cookies to assist you in accessing
              and navigating the Uganda-Saxony Partnership Site. The use of
              cookies will improve your experience when you browse our
              Uganda-Saxony Partnership Site, allows us to enhance the
              functionality of our Uganda-Saxony Partnership Site, increases
              security, measures use and effectiveness of our Uganda-Saxony
              Partnership Site and allows us to show you offers and content that
              may be of interest to you. We also use cookies for ad and content
              measurement, audience insights, product development, and to assist
              in promotional and marketing efforts. We use both session cookies
              (which exist only until you close your web browser) and persistent
              cookies (which exist for a longer, specified period of time or
              until you delete them) on the Uganda-Saxony Partnership Site.
              Cookies may be set by us (first-party cookies) or by another
              company at our request (third-party cookies). Cookies may also be
              set in connection with emails, newsletters or advertisements you
              receive from us. Information about you that we may collect from
              cookies includes, without limitation: your preferred language and
              location, browser information, operating system information, IP
              address, user behavior (including user acquisition information,
              websites visited, time spent on each website page, content
              requested, content consumed, etc.) and ad conversion data. We use
              these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are
              necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or because
              using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have
              considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in
              some cases, where required by law, or where you have consented to
              their use. Please see the cookie inventory below for a detailed
              list of the cookies we use.
